# Deep Learning assignment 2

This is the second assignment of the Deep Learning Course 2020. In this we deal with two parts:

# Part1: 

Train a neural network on Fashion MNIST dataset. Various configurations of the hyperparameters are tested to find the optimal setting.

# Part 2: 

Train a CNN on Fashion MNIST dataset. Different configurations of the hyperparameters are tested to find the optimal specifications.
